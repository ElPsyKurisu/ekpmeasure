Getting Started

Installation
############

To install to the latest version, use `pip`

.. code-block:: console
	
	pip install ekpmeasure

There are several pre-prepared apps (jupyter notebooks) which can be installed after `ekpmeasure`. These can be found in `Experiments <https://github.com/eparsonnet93/ekpmeasure/tree/main/src/ekpmeasure/experiments>`_. It is easiest to refer to the README for the experiment you wish to install.
