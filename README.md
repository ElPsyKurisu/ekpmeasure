# ekpmeasure
Repository of computer control code for various experiments as well as some analysis code for importing data from various tools into python


## Example usage of FE_switching analysis:
---
```python
from ekpmeasure.analysis.FE_switching import dataset, grouped_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


### To-do 2/23/21
- add ferroelectric switching experimental analysis + operational control for tds6604 (higher speed scope)
- add requirements.txt 
- add install instructions
